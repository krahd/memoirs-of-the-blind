# Memoirs of the Blind
Source code for the interactive installation **Memoirs of the Blind**

**[Tomas Laurenzo](http://laurenzo.net), 2018**

> *Memoirs of the Blind is an interactive installation consisting of a screen showing a black-and-white picture of a face with its eyes closed. This image at first remains still, however, when the interactor blinks, the installation detects it and takes a photo at the exact time of the blinking. Once the new face is obtained, it is processed (cropped, desaturated, and adjusted) and then it substitutes the displayed face.*
> 
> *The artwork becomes a testimony of its visitors, interacting with it, but not seeing it: a moment where the visitor becomes at the same time subject and object.*
